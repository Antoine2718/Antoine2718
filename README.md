### Mathematics • Physics • Software Engineering

## 🧠 Profile

I am an **undergraduate student in Mathematics (L2)** and a **Physics (L2) auditor**, driven by a strong interest in **theoretical foundations**, **computational modeling**, and **high-performance systems**.

My work lies at the intersection of:

- **Mathematical rigor**
- **Physical intuition**
- **Efficient software design**

I approach engineering problems from **first principles**, prioritizing correctness, clarity, and scalability.

## 🧮 Academic Background

- 📐 **BSc Mathematics (L2)**  
  Focus on analysis, algebra, and problem solving

- ⚛️ **Physics (L2 – Auditor)**  
  Mechanics, electromagnetism, and mathematical physics

These disciplines shape the way I design algorithms and reason about systems.

## ⚙️ Technical Stack

### Programming Languages
- 🐍 **Python**  
  → Scientific computing & machine learning  
  → **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**

- ⚡ **C / C++**  
  → Performance-critical systems, low-level control

- 🧠 **OCaml**  
  → Functional programming, type safety, formal reasoning

- 🚀 **Go**  
  → Concurrent systems, clean and scalable backend design

### Domains of Interest
- Machine Learning & numerical optimization
- Computational physics
- Algorithms & data structures
- High-performance and low-level computing

## 🧪 Engineering Philosophy

- **First principles thinking**
- **Minimalism over abstraction**
- **Performance is a feature**
- **Correctness before cleverness**

> *“The best code is the one that does exactly what is needed — nothing more.”*

## 📂 GitHub Repository

This GitHub contains:
- Experimental projects
- Academic and technical explorations
- Code written to be **read**, **tested**, and **improved**

Every project is an opportunity to refine both **theory** and **implementation**.
