# Antoine — passionate about engineering

I’m a 2nd-year Mathematics student (L2) and an auditing student in 2nd-year Physics (L2). 

I build practical AI systems and engineering prototypes with an emphasis on reproducibility, clean code and performance. Currently focused on machine learning, systems programming, and turning research ideas into usable tools.
